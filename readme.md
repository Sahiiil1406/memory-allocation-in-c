Dynamic memory allocation is the process of assigning the memory space during runtime of the program. This is implemented in C as the functions malloc, calloc, realloc, and free from stdlib. 

1.Malloc allocates a single block of memory of specified size and returns the pointer to the allocated block.

2.Calloc works similarly to malloc but initializes the allocated memory to zero.

3.Realloc is used to change the size of an allocated block of memory. 

4.Free deallocates memory associated with a pointer.
